In this ever-changing situation, IBVI is closely monitoring and adhering to the recommendations provided by experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Office of Personnel Management.</a></p>
        <p>Rest assured, NSG Customer Service and distribution center are both running as normal and all orders placed are shipping as normal. The challenges we could potentially face soon are replenishing our items that are out of stock. Most of our partnered manufacturing facilities are operating but that could change in a moment’s notice. We will do our best to keep you informed in the event anything changes. If you need to update the shipping address on a current order, or for any further questions or concerns, please get in touch with us by calling between the hours of 8a-6p EST, Monday-Friday, at 1.855.444.0847 or send us an email at <a href="mailto:service@nationalservicegear.org?subject=NSG%20COVID-19%20Inquiry">service@nationalservicegear.org</a>.
